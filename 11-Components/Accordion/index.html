            Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human
            intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans
            and mimic their actions. AI can be used for various applications,
            from speech recognition to complex problem-solving.

            Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and
            weather patterns, primarily due to human activities such as burning
            fossil fuels. These changes are causing more severe weather events,
            rising sea levels, and biodiversity loss.

            Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger that
            records the provenance of a digital asset. Originally designed for
            digital currency transactions, it is now used in various industries
            for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data storage.
